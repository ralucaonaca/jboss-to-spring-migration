I'm using a macos laptop and i'm used with the command line terminal

Steps to run the app:

1. Clone the project : git clone https://github.com/ralucaonaca/jboss-to-spring-migration.git
2. Before running the net command please make sure that mvn --version
points to the last version of mvn and is using the java version 21
For example:
mvn --version
Maven home: /Users/ralucaonaca-boca/apache-maven-3.9.9
Java version: 21.0.4, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "12.7.6", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"

3. If you already have installed the maven and also sdk java 21 then run the command 'mvn clean install'
4. Run the command 'docker-compose up' in the command line in the project where you clone it
5. Go to your favorite browser and try to access : http://localhost:8080/
